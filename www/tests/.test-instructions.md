# Running WebDriver Tests

## Quick Start

1. **Start the server** (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   # From project root
   npm test

   # Or from www/tests
   cd www/tests
   npm test
   ```

## The server is already running at http://localhost:8080

You're ready to run the tests!
